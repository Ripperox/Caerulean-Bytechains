Fix 1 -> Missing pragma solidity version specification

        pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    
Fix 2-> Make sure event is emitted

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);

Fix 3 -> Make sure address is correct

        require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");

## FIXED CODE 

````solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract BuggyToken {
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    constructor(uint256 _initialSupply) {
        totalSupply = _initialSupply;
        balances[msg.sender] = _initialSupply;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient address");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
}

Code is now optimized as it consists of error handling and the public from default constructor is removed to prevent extra gas fees
